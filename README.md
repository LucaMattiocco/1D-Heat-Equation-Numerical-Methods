# 1D Heat Equation Solver using Numerical Methods

This project implements numerical solutions to the one-dimensional (1D) heat equation using both explicit and implicit models. The goal is to compare the performance of four different numerical schemes against an analytical solution for heat conduction within a wall.

## Project Overview

The project solves the 1D heat equation using the following numerical methods:

- Richardson method
- Dufort-Frankel method
- Laasonen method
- Crank-Nicolson method

These methods are implemented in C++ using an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach. Detailed mathematical investigations reveal that explicit methods may not be well-suited for certain scenarios due to instability, whereas implicit methods, though more complex to implement, perform better in terms of convergence and stability.

The study is conducted with a particular focus on comparing computational results with the analytical solution.

## Problem Description

The problem considered in this project explores heat conduction within a wall. The setup is as follows:

- The wall has a length ![L = 31 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{m}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?L%20%3D%2031%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B-2%7D%20%5C%2C%20%5Ctext%7Bm%7D) and is assumed to be infinite in the other directions.
- The initial temperature of the wall is ![T_{\text{init}} = 38^\circ \, \text{C}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?T_%7B%5Ctext%7Binit%7D%7D%20%3D%2038%5E%5Ccirc%20%5C%2C%20%5Ctext%7BC%7D).
- The surface temperatures are ![T_{\text{surf}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?T_%7B%5Ctext%7Bsurf%7D%7D) on both sides of the wall:
  - At ![x = 0](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x%20%3D%200), ![T_{\text{surf}} = T_{\infty} = 38^\circ \, \text{C}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?T_%7B%5Ctext%7Bsurf%7D%7D%20%3D%20T_%7B%5Cinfty%7D%20%3D%2038%5E%5Ccirc%20%5C%2C%20%5Ctext%7BC%7D).
  - At ![x = L](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x%20%3D%20L), ![T_{\text{surf}} = 149^\circ \, \text{C}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?T_%7B%5Ctext%7Bsurf%7D%7D%20%3D%20149%5E%5Ccirc%20%5C%2C%20%5Ctext%7BC%7D).
- The wall is made of a nickel steel alloy (40% nickel) with a thermal diffusivity ![D = 93 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{hr}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?D%20%3D%2093%20%5C%2C%20%5Ctext%7Bcm%7D%5E2%2F%5Ctext%7Bhr%7D).

## Heat Equation

The heat equation governing this setup is derived using Fourier's Law:

![\frac{\partial T(x, t)}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 T(x, t)}{\partial x^2}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20T%28x%2C%20t%29%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20t%7D%20%3D%20D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5E2%20T%28x%2C%20t%29%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20x%5E2%7D)

where:
- ![T(x,t)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?T%28x%2C%20t%29) is the temperature inside the wall at position ![x](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x) and time ![t](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?t),
- ![D = \frac{\lambda}{\rho c}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Clambda%7D%7B%5Crho%20c%7D) is the thermal diffusivity in \(\text{m}^2/\text{s}\), where \(\lambda\) is the thermal conductivity, \(\rho\) is the density, and \(c\) is the specific heat capacity.
